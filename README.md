# 🦅 Crow’s Perch AI — Emotional Intelligence Engine

Real-time conversation insight, conflict analysis, tone mapping, and emotional pattern detection — built for performance, privacy, and psychological clarity.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Crow’s Perch AI is an advanced emotional-intelligence engine that helps users understand:

- tone  
- emotion  
- conflict patterns  
- communication style  
- intent clarity  
- toxicity spikes  
- hidden signals in conversation  

The system processes user conversations (text- or voice-based), and returns psychological insight, tone corrections, emotional maps, and behavioural analysis — all in real time.

## 🔒 Privacy Philosophy

Crow’s Perch AI never stores raw audio.  
Only *summaries, insights, and pattern data* are saved (locally or via user-approved cloud sync).  
Users are always in control of  
— what they save  
— what they delete  
— what they export  

No surveillance. No hidden logging. No risks.
